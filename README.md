# E09b-Lighting

This was an assignment for my Game Technology Class, where we expermented with lighting in a 3D environment. The goal was to match the the lighting found in the example below but I couldn't do it despite following the instructions and checking through it multpile times to see if I miss something. I probably did miss something, but I couldn't find it. What I have shared was the closest I got by following the instructions and trying not to make any mistakes.
